# Hotel Management System

This is my first C++ project: a simple Hotel Management System. It allows hotel staff to:

âœ… Allocate new rooms  
âœ… Search rooms by ID  
âœ… Update room details  
âœ… Delete rooms  
âœ… Sort and display all room records  
âœ… Save and load records from a file

## ðŸ’» How it Works

- Data is stored in a linked list during program execution.
- Records can be saved to a text file and loaded back in future runs.
- Saving and loading use basic file handling in C++.

*Note: The hotel data file is not included in this repository.*

I built this project to practice data structures and file handling in C++. It helped me improve my problem-solving and coding skills.

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements

- Add input validation for safer data entry
- Better error handling if the data file is corrupted
- Support other file formats like CSV or JSON
- Create a more interactive user interface
